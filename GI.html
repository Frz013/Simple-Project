                  Marechaussee Phantom. While Neuvillette upholds the rules of
                  the court with utmost reverence, he is quite aloof when
                  dealing with human emotions and often distances himself from
                  the public eye.

                  <br />
                  Despite his human appearance, he is actually the Hydro Dragon
                  Sovereign. However, he did not obtain full dragonhood until
                  the events of Archon Quest Chapter IV: Act V - Masquerade of
                  the Guilty when the Hydro Archon Focalors returned the powers
                  stolen by the Heavenly Principles from the Sovereigns back to
                  him.

                  As one of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, Arlecchino greatly

                  to betray the Tsaritsa if their interests ever were to differ.
                  Arlecchino is working to achieve her goals by acquiring the

                  importance and comes off as graceful and cordial.

                  Alhaitham is a member of the Haravatat of the Sumeru Akademiya
                  and the Akademiya's Scribe, responsible for documenting their
                  findings and drafting ordinances. Despite his brilliance,
                  people within the Akademiya are perplexed by Alhaitham due to
                  his unwillingness to aspire for higher office in spite of his
                  egocentricity, and many have been at odds with him for his
                  uncompromising view on rationality and the truth.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Alhaitham is a scholar who is fueled by a desire to understand
                  the underlying principles of the world around him. He greatly
                  values the pursuit of knowledge and dislikes meaningless noise
                  and matters that distract or divert him from his chosen
                  pursuits. To this end, while he is unambitious and enjoys
                  leisure, he will do what he deems necessary to maintain a
                  comfortable life. As a result, he is not fond of being a
                  leader, refusing the position of Grand Sage and when thrust
                  upon the position of Acting Grand Sage, expresses an intent to
                  resign as soon as possible.

                  At first glance, Hu Tao appears to be a quirky and cheerful
                  girl. She enjoys pranking people and despises sitting around
                  and doing nothing. She wishes to live her life to the fullest.
                  Her eccentric and off-the-wall personality often leaves people
                  with a negative impression of her, especially Qiqi, who states
                  that she has a "punchable face" and should be stored in the
                  fridge.In contrast, Xiao enjoys her sense of humor, finding it
                  irritating but interesting.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  On the other hand, when handling funerals and last rites, she
                  becomes more solemn and constantly reminds her employees to
                  never deviate from the client's requests. Due to the
                  importance and traditions of the parlor's duties, she
                  expresses a distaste towards people treating her or her
                  employees with suspicion whenever they go to work at night.

                  Flamboyant and imprudent, Furina lives for the thrill of the

                  and drama. She is impatient and has a childlike temper, and
                  she will occasionally make judgments that she doesn't mean,
                  which Neuvillette frequently has to control while conducting a
                  trial to avoid complications. While she enjoys being in the
                  spotlight, she only does so when it is focused at her
                  positively, breaking down in complete shambles should
                  something go out of plan and will try to save face at the
